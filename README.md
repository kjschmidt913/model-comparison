# model-comparison
An application that compares the output of different machine learning models on your data. You will be able to upload your data, select a model, enter specific parameters, and save results all within the browser. To make all of this happen in the browser, we'll be using [CovNetJS](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/index.html).
