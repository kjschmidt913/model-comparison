# model-comparison
An application that compares the output of different machine learning models on your data. You will be able to upload your data, select a model, enter specific parameters, and save results all within the browser. To make all of this happen in the browser, I'll be using [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/).
